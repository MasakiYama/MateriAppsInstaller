# DCore 

## SUMMARY 

 A tool for performing quantum many-body simulations based on dynamical mean-field theory. In addition to predefined models, one can construct and solve an ab-initio tight-binding model by using wannier 90 or RESPACK. We provide a post-processing tool for computing physical quantities such as the density of state and the momentum resolved spectral function. DCore depends on external libraries such as TRIQS and ALPSCore.
