# ERmod 

## SUMMARY 

 ERmod is software for calculating the free energy in soft, molecular aggregate. This program rapidly and accurately calculates the free energy of binding of a molecule in the aggregate through combination of the molecular dynamics simulation and the energy-representation theory of solvation. The solubility of a molecule can be determined with ERmod in arbitrary solvent including supercritical fluid and ionic liquid. Assessment is also possible for the binding strength and site of a molecule in micelle, lipid membrane or protein.
