## SUMMARY 

 A fast molecular dynamics simulator for ferroelectrics. This simulator can execute molecular dynamics calculations quickly by dealing with dipole interaction efficiently. It can simulate the physical property of microscopic ferroelectric thin film of tens of nanometers, which is important in FeRAM(Ferroelectric Random Access Memory), controlling the shapes and effects of inactivated layers.
