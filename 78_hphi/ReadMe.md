# HΦ 

## SUMMARY 

 An exact diagonalization package for a wide range of quantum lattice models (e.g. multi-orbital Hubbard model, Heisenberg model, Kondo lattice model). HΦ also supports the massively parallel computations. The Lanczos algorithm for obtaining the ground state and thermal pure quantum state method for finite-temperature calculations are implemented. In addition, dynamical Green’s functions can be calculated using
