# Kω 

## SUMMARY 

 Kω implements large-scale parallel computing of the shifted Krylov subspace method. Using Kω, dynamical correlation functions can be efficiently calculated. This application includes a mini-application for calculating dynamical correlation functions of quantum lattice models such as the Hubbard model, the Kondo model, and the Heisenberg model in combination with the quantum lattice solver of quantum many-body problems,
